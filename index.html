                <h2>The Advantage of OKLCH</h2>
                <div class="prose">
                    <p>Color models like <strong>RGB</strong> and <strong>HSL</strong> are based on how machines create color, not how humans perceive it. This can lead to unpredictable results. For instance, in HSL, changing the hue can also unintentionally change the perceived brightness of a color.</p>
                    <p><strong>OKLCH</strong> is a color space designed around human vision, which makes it more intuitive. Its components are:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>L (Lightness):</strong> How bright a color appears (0% to 100%). This is perceptually uniform.</li>
                        <li><strong>C (Chroma):</strong> The intensity of a color. 0 is gray, higher is more vivid.</li>
                        <li><strong>H (Hue):</strong> The angle on the color wheel (0-360).</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>This predictability is a significant advantage, as it allows for the creation of systematic and accessible color palettes. This is particularly useful for content that requires clarity, such as mathematics.</p>

                <h2>Creating a Palette for Math Content</h2>
                <p>An effective palette for mathematical content prioritizes clarity and focus. This page uses a dark theme, which can help reduce eye strain. The approach is to use layered surfaces and muted accents rather than pure black and white. For example, the <strong>Fundamental Theorem of Calculus</strong> below is highlighted with an accent color for emphasis.</p>

                <h2>Applying Color Theory with Your Palette</h2>
                <div class="prose">
                    <p>A well-defined set of color variables is the first step. The next is to apply them using established design principles to create a clear, effective, and aesthetically pleasing hierarchy. This is where color theory guides our decisions.</p>

                    <h3>The Core Roles: Surface, Text, and Accent</h3>
                    <p>Your palette is built on three fundamental roles that work together to structure the user interface:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Surface:</strong> These are the foundational colors of your UI. They create the canvas on which everything else is placed.</li>
                        <li><strong>Text:</strong> These colors are used for all readable content. The distinction between primary and secondary text colors is crucial for creating a scannable hierarchy.</li>
                        <li><strong>Accent:</strong> These are the colors that draw attention. They are used sparingly for interactive elements like links, buttons, and, in our case, key equations.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>The 60-30-10 Rule: A Framework for Balance</h3>
                     <p>The 60-30-10 rule is a classic design principle that adapts perfectly to UI design, providing a simple framework for creating a balanced and harmonious color scheme.</p>
